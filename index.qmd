ようこそ! 

This is my personal repository for datasets, lecture notes & assignment submissions on EDUC8009 - DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICS. 

As this course is tailored for SPSS users, here's the problem: I can only get my hands on the legal copy in our computer lab, where the machines are about as speedy as *a sloth on a lazy day*, sporting a single-channel 8GB of RAM. Apple may claim that 8 is enough (even greater than 16) for most users, and we all know that’s just some optimistic marketing. 

So, I decided to take a detour and embrace the open-source revolution with sweety sidekick: `python=3.10` armed with the duo of Doolin and Dal..., sorry, `pandas` and `scipy.stats`. An `R=4.3.3` implementation will also be included in the solution of my assignment as well.
