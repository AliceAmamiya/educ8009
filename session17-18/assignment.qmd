## The line plot and `ggplot2`

Although conducting ANOVA or ANCOVA in the world of `Python` or `R` is not as straightforward as training a even more complex ML model. Plotting could be easier. So, 

\begin{center}
\textbf{Challenge accepted}
\end{center}

Recall back our second question: 

> Draw a line chart using the ⟨ Plots ⟩ option. Let ⟨ Horizontal Axis ⟩ and ⟨ Separate Lines ⟩ be alcohol consumption and facial attractiveness respectively, and include error bars showing the 95% confidence intervals of the means.

It's quite simple to just draw a line-plot with error bar. 

# Context
A marketing manager tested the benefit of soft drinks for curing hangovers. He took 15 people and got them drunk. Then he measured how drunk the person got on a scale of `0 = straight edge` to `10 = flapping about like a haddock out of water`. The next morning as they awoke and dehydrated, he gave five of them water to drink, five of them Lucozade (a very nice glucose-based UK drink [^1]) and the remaining five a leading brand of cola [^2]. These people were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. He measured how well they felt (on a scale from 0 = I feel like death to 10 = I feel really full of beans and healthy) two hours later. The dataset is saved in `hangover.sav`. The goal is to study whether different drinks (treatment) affect how the drunk people feel (outcome).

[^1]: And it is now owned by Japanese (SUNTORY bought it from GSK in 2013). 
[^2]: The leading brand? That should be the reeeeeeeeeeeeeed one.

# Objectives
1. Draw a scatterplot to check the relationship between how drunk the person was before treatment and how well they felt after treatment.
2. Is there any evidence of unlucky randomization, i.e., people in the three groups differ in how drunk they were before the treatment?
3. Consider applying ANCOVA with how drunk they felt before treatment as a covariate. Assess whether there is an interaction between treatment and the covariate.
4. Conduct an ANCOVA and report the adjusted means of the three groups.
5. To study the causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome, is ANOVA a valid choice? How about ANCOVA? Which one do you prefer? Why?
6. Briefly summarize your findings.

# Solutions

In this experiment, given: 

$Y$: Measures of how well a hangover person feel after the soft drink treatment. 
$X_c$: Measures of how drunk a person got last night.
$A$: Types of drink. Group $A_1$ for water, $A_2$ for Lucozade and $A_3$ for Cola. 

## Q1: The scatterplot
The scatterplot between how drunk the person was before the treatment ($X_c$) and how well they felt after treatment ($Y$) is shown as @fig-q1-scatter, $X_c$ and $Y$ showed a linear relation with no bivariate outliers.

## Q2: Independence of $X_c$ and $A$

To reveal whether people in the three groups differ in how drunk they were before the treatment, a one-way ANOVA was conducted and the results were listed as @tbl-mean-between-groups. 

| Source                 | SS       | $df$  | MS    | $F$     | $p$   |
|------------------------|----------|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| drink                  | 8.400    | 2     | 4.200 | 1.355   | .295  |
| Error                  | 37.200   | 12    | 3.100 |         |       |

: {#tbl-mean-between-groups}

The result showed that the main effect of drink is not significant, with $F(2, 12) = 1.355$, $p=0.295$, that indicated that statically there were no differences on the average drunk level between all three groups. That means the $X_c$ and $A$ are independent, the assumption of ANCOVA appeared to be satisfied. 

## Q3: Homogeneity of regression slopes

| Source                | SS            | $df$  | MS        | $F$       | $p$   |
|-----------------------|-----------    |-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| drink * drunk	        |11.610	        | 3	    | 3.870	    | 6.951	    | 0.007	|
| Error	                |6.124	        | 11	| 0.557		|           |       |

To assess whether there was an interaction between $A$ and $X_c$, a preliminary ANCOVA was run using the SPSS GLM procedure with a custom model that included an $A \times X_c$ interaction term. This interaction was statistically significant with an $F(3, 11) = 6.951$, $p = 0.007$. This indicates that the effect of the treatment on how well the person feels depends on how drunk they felt before the treatment.

In conclusion, there is a significant interaction between the treatment and the covariate, meaning the initial feeling of drunkenness influences the treatment effect on how well the person feels.[^3] The assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes may be violated. 

[^3]: I tested on myself and that's true.

## Q4: ANCOVA and the adjusted means of Group $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$.

| Source                | SS            | $df$  | MS        | $F$       | $p$       | $\eta_p^2$ |
|-----------------------|-----------    |-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| drunk	                | 9.856	        | 1     | 9.856     | 24.568    | <0.001	| 0.691      |
| drink	                | 3.464	        | 2     | 1.732	    | 4.318	    | 0.041	    | 0.440      |
| Error	                | 4.413	        | 11	| 0.401		|           |           |   		 |

An ANCOVA was conducted to examine the effect of drink type on recovery while controlling for initial drunkenness. The effect of how drunk the person felt the night before was significant, $F(1,11) = 24.568$, $p < 0.001$, $\eta_p^2 = 0.691$, indicated that pre-existing drunkenness significantly affects how well the person feels. The treatment had a significant effect on how well the person felt, $F(2,11) = 4.318$, $p = 0.041$, $\eta_p^2 = 0.440$. 

The adjusted means were given in @tbl-adjusted-means, suggested that participants who drank Lucozade felt better than those who drank Water or Cola.

|           |           | Mean of $Y$, adjusted for $X_c$ | Unadjusted Mean of $Y$ | 
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Group 1   | Water     | 5.110                           | 5.00                   |
| Group 2   | Lucozade  | 6.239                           | 5.80                   |
| Group 3   | Cola      | 5.252                           | 5.80                   |

: Adjusted means (evaluated at initial drunkenness = 3.40). {#tbl-adjusted-means}

## Q5: ANOVA or ANCOVA

If there's another other chance for me I would like to say I prefer neither of them then go for casual inference. I swear I WILL master this method after Christmas and Lunar New Year recess. 

In general, ANOVA is used to compare the means of different groups and determine if there are statistically significant differences between them. It assumes that all groups are treated equally and does not adjust for any confounding variables or covariates that might affect the dependent variable. In contrast, ANCOVA extends ANOVA by including one or more covariate(s) that can influence the dependent variable. By controlling for these covariates, ANCOVA adjusts the group means, providing a clearer understanding of the treatment effects while accounting for variability attributed to other factors.

From we see significant effects both from the covariate ("drunk") and the treatment ("drink"), indicating that initial drunkenness plays a substantial role in how participants feel subsequently.

ANCOVA is the better choice here for several reasons:

1. Power: By accounting for the variance explained by initial drunkenness, ANCOVA reduces error variance and increases statistical power to detect treatment effects. This is particularly important with the small sample size ($n = 15$).

2. Precision: Initial drunkenness strongly predicts recovery (shown by the large effect size). Controlling for this relationship provides a more precise estimate of the treatment effect.

3. Individual Differences: Even with successful randomization, individuals entered the study with different levels of drunkenness. ANCOVA adjusts for these pre-existing differences, giving us a clearer picture of the drink effects.

Therefore, while both analyses are valid given the successful randomization, ANCOVA provides a more powerful and precise test of the causal relationship between drink type and recovery in this study.

Again Thanks for all the torlerance this semester. 

May all the cats be with you and your journey in UM. 

Last month one of best friend in UM, a hard-core CS guy, as nerd as I do, who works in Kingsoft Office, came to see me (of course his *alma mater*).  

True, FED or even UM sucked. But still, we may find something interesting here. 

Happy thanksgiving and メリークリスマス.
