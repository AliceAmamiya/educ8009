# Objectives
1. What do 1, 2, and 3 mean in variable “gender”? What are their percentages in the sample?
2. Draw a barplot of “gender” whose 𝑦-axis represents the percentage of each group.
3. Draw a histogram of “day_1”. Is there anything wrong with this variable?
4. How many cases have missing values for “day_2”?
5. (Extra credit) Exclude the outlier. 

`base-r` version `4.3.3`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Using `foreign` is truly a pain for handling SPSS data, I'll use heaven instead. 
download_festival <- haven::read_sav('./datasets/download.sav')
```

## First peek
```{r}
print('A summary and structure of this dataset')
summary(download_festival)
str(download_festival)
```

## Q1a
> What do 1, 2, and 3 mean in variable “gender”?
```{r}
print('Q1a: What do 1, 2, and 3 mean in variable “gender”?')
download_festival$gender %>%
  attr('labels')
```

## Q1b
> What are their percentages in the sample?
```{r}
print('Q1b: What are their percentages in the sample?')
gender_percentage <- download_festival %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(Percentage = n() / nrow(download_festival) * 100)
print(gender_percentage)
```

## Q2
> Draw a barplot of `gender` whose $y$-axis represents the percentage of each group.
```{r}
download_festival$gender <- factor(download_festival$gender, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c('Male', 'Female', 'Non-binary'))

ggplot(download_festival, aes(x=gender)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab('Gender') + 
  ylab('Percentage') + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  ggtitle('Percentage of Gender')
```

## Q3
> Draw a histogram of `day_1`. Is there anything wrong with this variable?
```{r}
print('Draw a histogram of “day_1”. Is there anything wrong with this variable?')
ggplot(download_festival, aes(x=day_1)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 1, bins=15) + 
  xlab('Day 1') + 
  ylab('Frequency / Count') + 
  ggtitle('Histogram of hygiene score in the 1st Day (Raw data)')
  print('An outlier found.')
```

## Q4
> How many cases have missing values for `day_2`?
```{r}
print('How many cases have missing values for “day_2”?')
summary(download_festival)
print('Answer\'s on the 7th row, 546 cases missing.')
```

## Q5
> Exclude the outlier. 
```{r}
print('Exclude Ms. Laundry Pod.')
download_festival_no_outliers <- download_festival[download_festival$day_1 <= 5, ]
ggplot(download_festival_no_outliers, aes(x=day_1)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 1, bins=15) + 
  labs(title='Histogram of Hygiene Scores on the 1st Day', 
        subtitle='Outlier removed') + 
  xlab('Day 1') + 
  ylab('Frequency / Count')
```
