    "## Background\n",
    "A biologist was worried about the potential health effects of music festivals. So, one year she went to the Download Music Festival (http://www.downloadfestival.co.uk) and measured the hygiene of 810 concert goers over the three days of the festival. In theory each person was measured on each day but because it was difficult to track people down, there were some missing data on days 2 and 3. Hygiene was measured using a technique that results in a score ranging between 0 (you smell like a rotting corpse) and 5 (you smell like sweet roses). Sanitation is not always great at these places, so this researcher predicted that personal hygiene would go down dramatically over the three days of the festival. The data file is called download.sav."

I also prepared the R flavor of this lab work with `base-r=4.3.3`. My advisor is an R person, I think it's better to speak the same language as him. \n",
