    "# Context\n",
    "An instructor of EDUC8009 noticed that a lot of students became very stressed about this course, so he designed a questionnaire to measure their fear of statistics. Each item was a statement followed by a five-point Likert scale: \n",
    "\n",
    "1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only item 2 is reverse-scored. The data are saved in `fear.sav`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "1. Compute Cronbach’s alpha of all the items but item 2. Is the reliability high?\n",
    "2. If you can delete an item to improve the scale, which item will you delete? Why?\n",
    "3. To compute Cronbach’s alpha of all the items, we need recode item 2 first. Describe the distribution of the new variable you just generated.\n",
    "4. Compute Cronbach’s alpha of all the items in the scale."
