Apple may claim that 8 is enough (even greater than 16) for most users, and we all know that’s just some optimistic marketing.\nSo, I decided to take a detour and embrace the open-source revolution with sweety sidekick: python=3.10 armed with the duo of Doolin and Dal…, sorry, pandas and scipy.stats. An R=4.3.3 implementation will also be included in the solution of my assignment as well.\n\n\n\nIt all starts from iris and mtcars.\n\n\nRiko",
